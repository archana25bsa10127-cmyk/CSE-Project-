 🛡 Phishing Email Detection System

 📌 Project Overview
Phishing emails are a major cybersecurity threat, often tricking users into revealing sensitive information.  
This project uses *Machine Learning and NLP techniques* to classify emails as *Phishing* or *Legitimate* based on their content and metadata.



 🎯 Objectives
- Detect phishing emails using ML classification
- Preprocess and analyze raw email text data
- Identify suspicious patterns such as URLs, keywords, and sender info
- Provide a real-time prediction system for new emails



 🚀 Features
✔ Email dataset preprocessing and cleaning  
✔ NLP feature extraction (TF-IDF / Bag of Words)  
✔ Machine Learning model training and evaluation  
✔ Confusion matrix and performance metrics  
✔ Real-time phishing prediction for new emails  
✔ Optional Web UI (Flask / Streamlit)



 🧠 Technologies Used
| Category | Tools |
|---------|-------|
| Programming | Python |
| Libraries | Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, NLTK |
| Visualization | Matplotlib, Seaborn |
| Deployment (optional) | Flask / Streamlit |
