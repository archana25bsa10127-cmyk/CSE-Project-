# 📄 Project Statement — Phishing Email Detection System

## 🔍 Problem Statement
Phishing attacks continue to be one of the most common and dangerous forms of cybercrime.  
Attackers send deceptive emails disguised as trusted sources to trick users into revealing sensitive information such as passwords, bank details, and personal data.  
Manual detection is difficult and unreliable due to large email volumes and sophisticated tactics.  
Therefore, an automated prediction system is required to identify phishing emails accurately and protect users from cyber threats.
